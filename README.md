This is the source code for the method as described in our paper:
**CELT: Using feature layer interactions to improve semantic segmentation models**. The lines 81-139 of Architecture/encoder/resnet.py are about how to insert CELT into the encoder of the existing segmentation models. You can apply CELT on your own models, which is a very easy idea to method.

## Data

In order to make it easier for the readers to reproduce and understand the code, we have provided a small amount of example data used in our experiment under the **image_samples** folder, where each dataset (CamVid, Skin Lesion, CUB Birds) provides five training, validation and test images.


## Run the codes
Install the environment.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Train and test the model.
```bash
python CELT_Unet_CamVid.py
```


## File declaration

**data/SemmedDB**： contains all relations extracted from SemmedDB, which are used for constructing the Knowledge Graph in our experiment. The whole "predications.txt" contains **39,133,975** relations, we just leave a small sample "predications.txt" file here which contain **100** relation. The whole "predications.txt" file coule be downloaded from 
  
**data/TTD**： contains the drug, target and disease relations retrieved from Theraputic Target Database.
    
**experimental_data.py**: constuct the drug-target-disease associations from TTD and Knowledge Graph.

**knowledge_graph.py**: construct the Knowledge Graph used in our experiment.
 
**data_loader.py**：used to load traing and test data.

**main.py**：used to train and test the models
